# MAGAb - Make Arch Great Again, btw

A repo whos sole purpose is to MAGA -- Make Arch Great, again, btw.

## Trying to join the unbrainwashed, free-thinking, far-right Arch movement?

If you are, then run the below commands; and become a great, perhaps even the greatest Arch user.

Infact, I knew an Arch user some time ago, great guy - really, perhaps even the best guy.

But what we're here for is to become just like that guy -

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MrDwarf7/MAGA_make_arch_great_again.git
```

Or if you use the el-fancy github-cli already before setting things up you can use:

```sh
gh repo clone MrDwarf7/MAGA_make_arch_great_again
```

```sh
cd MAGA_make_arch_great_again/
```

```sh
chmod +x ./install.sh
```

### Go forth and MAGA!
btw
